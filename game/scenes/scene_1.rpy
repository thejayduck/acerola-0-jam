  "I woke up from my long nap on the uncomfortable sofa and stretched my entire body."
  "How long have I been sleeping for? My entire body feels sluggish… I guess sleeping in the middle of the day wasn't a good idea after all."
  "I then open my eyes and let them adjust to the brightly lit room. I look at the two people sitting across me and blankly stare at them."

  "The first one I look at is Franz, he doesn't react to my stare in any way."

  "We live under the same roof, not because we wanted to, but because at the beginning of the first semester of the university we study at, conducted a random poll, and we got stuck with each other ever since."
  "Not that I am complaining or anything… he has been a good friend since then."  

  "I guess he is just as tired as I am…"

  "I then focus on Maike, and she immediately returns my stare with a colder one."

  maike "..."

  maike "What is it?"

  cassian "When'd you arrive here?"

  "Maike is… not sure actually, she has been following me for a long time."
  "Her presence didn't bother me so I never had to kick her out of the apartment."
  "Unlike Franz and I, she lives with her parents."
  "I believe it's around a 30-minute train ride from where the university is, it must be pretty nice to eat homemade food every day, and not have to think about the upcoming rent."

  maike "You were the one to suggest that we all gather and finish our work."
  cassian "Oh right that… I will do it another day."

  "We still have a few days until the deadline, what is she so worked up about on a whatever-thousand-word essay."

  cassian "W-What are you staring at…"

  maike "You keep saying that but end up paraphrasing my entire essay at the end, I would be shocked if you managed your time well for once."
  maike "I might consider not showing you my whatever-thousand-word essay this time."

  "Urk!" #? hpunch

  cassian "Huh?! D-Did you read my min- are you an esper perchance?!"

  show maike crossed normal with dissolve

  maike "Like hell I am! The way you think is so straightforward a monkey can memorize your thought patterns in a few days."

  cassian "Heh- Fair point, I'll give you that. But even without your help, I'll manage to finish it. After all- {nw}"

  show franz sad

  franz "Sorry~ I won't do it again~"

  cassian "So, what did you remember?"

  maike "Probably the fact that he doesn't have time to finish the essay on time."

  "I don't think he is the kind of person to worry about things like that."
  "I kept that thought to myself."

  show franz hip normal with dissolve

  franz "Heheh… There's apparently a new fortune teller in the city, quite close too!"

  cassian "There's another one? Is the job that profitable that people make a lot of money out of it?"

  maike "..."

  cassian "Now that I mention that… We got scammed far too many times thanks to those 'new fortune tellers', haven't we."

  show maike tired

  maike "Indeed."

  "I don't want to get legally robbed out of my own money again."
  "We've been to an insane amount of them thanks to Franz, and unsurprisingly all of them turned out to be fake."
  "Of course, without proof that we paid for the place, we weren't allowed a refund, even after they got caught."
  "I am starting to run short on my savings, I don't want to start working again to get by."

  cassian "We are not going. {nw}"

  franz "What about you maike, do you want to join us?"

  cassian "Hey hey I said I am not coming! {nw}"

  "We've been following behind Franz for the past 30 minutes or so, I am hesitant to look and confirm the time on my phone."
  "I look at Maike walking behind me, she seems fine for someone who prefers to spend hours on end working on assignments."

  franz "Owwww~!"

  "Maike and I planted our fists into Franz's skull."
  "Tough. Was the first thing that came to my mind as soon as I realized that he screamed while laughing."
  "Is this guy for real?"

  cassian "Will you stop exploring every corner of the city, are you trying to get us lost?"

  show franz annoyed

  franz "What are you two talking about?"

  franz "Can't you see how undecorated this place is, there aren't any big signs directing to this place, and is only known by those who care about their fortunes."
  
  franz "The fortune teller must be a big deal to do that."

  franz "Even I can acknowledge that the previous locations were sketchy… but this one is special."

  "This guy is hopeless. This isn't the first time we came across a fortune teller shop that looked different compared to the competition, yet he keeps praising each one of them."

  franz "..."

  cassian "Franz- {nw}"

  franz "Ah sorry, I was trying to find the light switch."

  cassian "Hold on, I'll turn on my flashlight and find a light switch."

  "She nods slightly at my question."

  "Anyways, why can't I… see anything in this place? Is it one of those paints that absorb the majority of the light?"
